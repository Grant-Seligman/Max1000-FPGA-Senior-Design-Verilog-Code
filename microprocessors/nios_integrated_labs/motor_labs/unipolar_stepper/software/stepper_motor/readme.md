Readme - Stepper motor controller

DESCRIPTION:
This application utilizes the Altera small C library to get user inputs and translate them to data that is then sent to the memory mapped hardware modules. Some already existing C function had to be recreated due to the limitations of the Altera small C library, see NIOS Software Developer Handbook for more info. A stepper motor’s speed is controlled by changing the frequency at which the state machine runs, with the outputs directed to the Half-H driver’s (SN754410NE in this case) A (input) pins. The direction of the motor depends on the direction the state machine is running. The responsibility of this application is to read user input from the NIOS console and convert it to an unsigned 16bit value for the frequency for the variable stepdown module. Also, an unsigned 8bit value for the direction module (only the LSB is sent). A list of settings that were supplied are then displayed, and the user is prompted to enter a new frequency and direction.
